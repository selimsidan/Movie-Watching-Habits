# Movie Watching Habits - CS 210 Data Science Project 
## Description
As a regular movie watcher, I’ve been aware of my movie watching habits changing drastically in different periods of the year, yet I wasn’t sure about what was causing those changes and if there were some factors I wasn’t even aware of. Luckily, I’ve been keeping track of all the movies I’ve watched since I’ve started Sabancı University on Letterboxd, making the data of my diary in Letterboxd ideal to explore the effects of periods like fall/spring semesters and winter/summer breaks. My motivation for this project was to find the relationships between the number of movies watched, lengths of movies, time of the year and location while using this dataset. In order to do so I’ve used exploratory data analysis techniques such as correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization with matplotlib library and machine learning techniques such as linear regression, random forest with hyperparameter tuning to make accurate predictions. You can find the detailed report explaining the steps and findings of my project in Project Report.pdf and the necessary code with basic descriptions of the processes in the Jupyter Notebook named CS 210 Project Final.ipynb.
